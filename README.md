#### DX ways to resolve issues (that are assigned to Builders pillar)

- Docs issue = create an issue for docs & write content for a PR.
- Common FAQ = create article under [Github:community/Discussion/Q&A](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/categories/q-a)
- Product feature = handover to Product to own, input on solution design and timeline
- Engineering feature = handover to Engineering to own, input on solution design and timeline
- Engineering bug = log an issue to corresponding repos (e.g. Lotus, built-in actor, fvm-ref)

## FVM DX support to hackathons

In addition to Builders Funnel team runs hackathons, process [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/101NQn-vEjGMQqse_ccwP2Qaf0YH9yMHnb1lZny4QNOQ/edit#).

Retro reports found [here](https://airtable.com/shrMRgnwFYnMlHyvc). From the retro reports, any found issues will follow [pain point tracker](#_z6mr2ogeiacp) process.
